Based on the large number of requests for calls with the FedRAMP PMO and the need for more time to gather demand verification, we have decided to **extend the** [**FedRAMP Business Case**](https://gsa-burra.formstack.com/forms/fedramp_business_case_for_jab_prioritization) **due date to August 31st at 5:00pm eastern**. 

The FedRAMP PMO wants to support CSPs and help them submit the best Business Case possible. Over the next week, we encourage CSPs who are planning on submitting a FedRAMP Business Case to reach out to the FedRAMP PMO to solicit feedback on their case or to strategize how to gather as much proof of demand as possible. 

Please e-mail [info@fedramp.gov](mailto:info@fedramp.gov) to set up a call with our team or to ask any questions you have about your submission. 

We look forward to reviewing your FedRAMP Business Cases next week!
