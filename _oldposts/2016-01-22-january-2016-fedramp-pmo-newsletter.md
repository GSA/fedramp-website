                                  Ashley Mahan is leading a focused outreach effort to identify agency leads who will coordinate cross-government use of FedRAMP. Ashley will visit with each agency within the Executive Branch as well as a number of other agencies and state-governments. This is each agency’s chance to speak directly with the PMO about their experience with the FedRAMP process and provide feedback and potential improvements.
