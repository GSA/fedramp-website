This past year was extremely busy for the FedRAMP program with many exciting highlights. I&#8217;m so proud of all the hard work by the PMO team and our stakeholders to continue to advance this program, and I wanted to share some of the most notable accomplishments with you. Thank you all for your input and support. I look forward to an even more impressive FY17!
