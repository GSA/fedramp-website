We’re excited to see our first RARs coming in from CSPs! As we’ve reviewed these first submissions, we’ve found some things that could be clearer as to the intent of what we are asking for within the RAR. 

When released, we envisioned that the RAR template would be a living document, and we have completed our first update to the [RAR Template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2016/11/FedRAMP-Readiness-Assessment-Report-Template_102116-3.docx). This does not change any of the testing requirements, but adds some additional clarity around descriptions and information the PMO is looking for when reviewing a RAR , primarily around the Executive Summary and Federal Mandates.

All RARs submitted to the FedRAMP PMO must use this new version beginning today. If you have any questions, please reach out to info@fedramp.gov.
