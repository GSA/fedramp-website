As part of our ongoing [training](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/training/) series, the FedRAMP PMO will unveil a new training module in early October.

This module focuses on the newly implemented [Review and Approve](https://www.fedramp.gov/participate/review-and-approve-process/) (R&A) process. This training describes the end-to-end R&A process, beginning with first contact by an Applicant (Cloud Service Provider [CSP] or Agency) through posting of the Authorization Package in the FedRAMP Secure Repository. The FedRAMP PMO has redesigned the application process to the FedRAMP Program to be more efficient, structured, and scalable.

Students will learn:


* The roles and responsibilities of CSPs, FedRAMP PMO, and Authorizing Officials


* The designations given to Authorization Packages throughout the R&A Process


* How the FedRAMP PMO conducts the Initial and Detailed Reviews of an Authorization Package


* The actions an Applicant must take to properly prepare and apply for a FedRAMP Authorization


* The criteria for approving an Authorization Package Â 


Like the introductory course, the R&A process training is not mandatory. However, the FedRAMP PMO recommends that all Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) take this course before submitting an application or writing a System Security Plan (SSP). All FedRAMP training courses are available on-demand and online through Blackboard.
