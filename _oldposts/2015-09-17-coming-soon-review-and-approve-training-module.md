As part of our ongoing [training](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/training/) series, the FedRAMP PMO will unveil a new training module in early October.

This module focuses on the newly implemented [Review and Approve](https://www.fedramp.gov/participate/review-and-approve-process/) (R&A) process. This training describes the end-to-end R&A process, beginning with first contact by an Applicant (Cloud Service Provider [CSP] or Agency) through posting of the Authorization Package in the FedRAMP Secure Repository. The FedRAMP PMO has redesigned the application process to the FedRAMP Program to be more efficient, structured, and scalable. _Read the whole story_.

Students will learn:

<li style="font-weight: 400">
  The roles and responsibilities of CSPs, FedRAMP PMO, and Authorizing Officials
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  The designations given to Authorization Packages throughout the R&A Process
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  How the FedRAMP PMO conducts the Initial and Detailed Reviews of an Authorization Package
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  The actions an Applicant must take to properly prepare and apply for a FedRAMP Authorization
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  The criteria for approving an Authorization Package Â 
</li>

Like the introductory course, the R&A process training is not mandatory. However, the FedRAMP PMO recommends that all Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) take this course before submitting an application or writing a System Security Plan (SSP). All FedRAMP training courses are available on-demand and online through Blackboard.
