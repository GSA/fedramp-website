FedRAMP is pleased to announce the second training course in the [FedRAMP Online Training Series](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/training/). The goal of this course, FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP) Required Documents, is to familiarize you with required documentation for initial package submission and give a detailed overview of FedRAMP’s SSP template and its supporting documents. This course aims to give cloud service Providers (CSPs) an understanding of the detail and rigor required by the FedRAMP PMO. In addition, we will review the SSP for a cloud system and provide the information and guidelines that you need to accurately document the FedRAMP security controls for the cloud system.

This course is **mandatory** for package submission regardless of intended path (JAB, Agency, or CSP Supplied). This training module contains an online test of the material covered in this course. A completed training certificate and customer satisfaction survey must be presented to the PMO when applying to FedRAMP. The name on the training certificate must match the contact information on the SSP. Send completed training and survey certificates to <info@fedramp.gov> with subject line “_CSP Name_ , SSP Training.”

Our Online Training Series is a part of FedRAMP Forward, a roadmap to increase compliance and agency participation, improve efficiencies, and facilitate adaptation. The PMO will deliver new courses in the coming months focusing on CSP, Federal agency and third-party assessment organization needs. Please contact the PMO at <info@fedramp.gov> if you have any questions about this course.
