FedRAMP’s Agency Evangelist is coming to a Federal Agency near you! 

Ashley Mahan is leading a focused outreach effort to pin-point agency leads who will coordinate cross-government use of FedRAMP. Additionally, she will identify how they’re using FedRAMP and get a better understanding of types of CSPs they want to use. Ashley will visit with each agency within the Executive Branch as well as a number of other agencies. This is each agency’s chance to speak directly with the PMO about their experience with the FedRAMP process and provide feedback and potential improvements. 

So far, Ashley has met with the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Department of the Interior (DOI), the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the state of Minnesota’s IT Services department. Ashley has participated  in the [ATARC Cloud Innovation Lab](http://www.atarc.org/innovation-labs/cloud/) and appeared at multiple events to include [AFCEA](http://www.afcea.org/site/), [Bloomberg Government](http://about.bgov.com/), and [MS-ISAC](http://msisac.cisecurity.org/).

But how will you know #WheresAshley? Follow along with Ashley on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/fedrampashley">@FedRAMPAshley</a> or follow the hashtag “#WheresAshley”. The PMO will post notices of upcoming meetings, or you can request a meeting with Ashley by emailing <a href="mailto:info@FedRAMP.gov">info@FedRAMP.gov</a> or <a href="mailto:Agency@FedRAMP.gov">Agency@FedRAMP.gov</a>.  

Keep up with Ashley as she spreads the gospel of FedRAMP!
