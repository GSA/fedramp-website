Have you ever emailed the FedRAMP PMO to ask about our online training? Wondering when the next course will be available? What will it focus on? Have you ever thought that a particular subject would make a useful FedRAMP training module?

Did you answer “YES” to any of these questions? Then you should complete FedRAMP’s [Training Needs](https://goo.gl/forms/14jnjk1gEwdJCApB3) survey. If you said “no,” then you should still complete the survey because we need as much feedback as possible.

We take customer service very seriously at FedRAMP. Over the past year, we’ve launched a number of initiatives to make the process more understandable and easier to navigate. One of those initiatives is our online training program. We’ve gotten some really great feedback on the training and we feel like we’re ready to expand our course offerings, but we need to hear from our customer base first.

The [Training Needs](https://goo.gl/forms/14jnjk1gEwdJCApB3) survey asks questions on what courses you’d like to have developed, the best methods to deliver FedRAMP training, and how often you’d like training to be developed. The survey takes only about 4-5 minutes to complete, and all responses are completely anonymous. The more feedback we receive, the better equipped we will be to improve our current offerings and develop new training to meet your needs.

Please respond to the [Training Needs](https://goo.gl/forms/14jnjk1gEwdJCApB3) survey by Friday, September 30th.  We greatly appreciate your feedback!
