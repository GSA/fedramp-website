FedRAMP’s “Review and Approve (R&A) Process” [training module](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/training/) is now available on [Blackboard](https://governmenttraining.blackboard.com/). This training is designed to help FedRAMP Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and agency applicants understand the process to achieve FedRAMP compliance. 

Students will learn:

<li style="font-weight: 400">
  The roles and responsibilities of CSPs, FedRAMP PMO, and Authorizing Officials
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  The designations given to authorization packages throughout the R&A process
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  How the FedRAMP PMO conducts Initial and Detailed Reviews of an authorization package
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  The actions an applicant must take to properly prepare and apply for a FedRAMP authorization
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  The criteria used to approve an authorization package
</li>

Like the introductory course, the R&A process training is not mandatory. However, the FedRAMP PMO recommends all CSPs to take this course before submitting an application or writing a System Security Plan (SSP). All FedRAMP training courses are available on-demand and online through Blackboard.
