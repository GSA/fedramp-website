FedRAMP’s “Review and Approve (R&A) Process” [training module](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/training/) is now available on [Blackboard](https://governmenttraining.blackboard.com/). This training is designed to help FedRAMP Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and agency applicants understand the process to achieve FedRAMP compliance.

Students will learn:

* The roles and responsibilities of CSPs, FedRAMP PMO, and Authorizing Officials

* The designations given to authorization packages throughout the R&A process

* How the FedRAMP PMO conducts Initial and Detailed Reviews of an authorization package

* The actions an applicant must take to properly prepare and apply for a FedRAMP authorization

* The criteria used to approve an authorization package


Like the introductory course, the R&A process training is not mandatory. However, the FedRAMP PMO recommends all CSPs to take this course before submitting an application or writing a System Security Plan (SSP). All FedRAMP training courses are available on-demand and online through Blackboard.
