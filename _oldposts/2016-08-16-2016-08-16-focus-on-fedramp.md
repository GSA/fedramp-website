However, we haven’t always been the best at sharing what’s going on in the FedRAMP world or what’s on our mind outside of our individual conversations with stakeholders. But today we’re launching <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/focus-on-fedramp/">Focus on FedRAMP</a>, a blog where we’re going to share more about the things we’re working on, the things we’re developing, and the things we see coming up in the future.
</p>

<p class="gd_p">
  There’s a lot we do at FedRAMP we want to share with you. Transparency and collaboration will be at the heart of <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/focus-on-fedramp/">Focus on FedRAMP</a>.
</p>

  * Ever wondered when we’re going to be releasing updated templates and want to know easily what the changes were? We’ll share updates and detail changes here.
  * Hearing concerns about how agencies are using or not using FedRAMP? We’ll do mythbusting and clarify how to use FedRAMP here.
  * Are you wondering how to get started with FedRAMP or what the process looks like? We’ll provide real life examples and stories of FedRAMP success here.
  * Want to be a part of the conversation as we iterate FedRAMP to make it more efficient and transparent? We’ll begin conversations around topics like a streamlined Continuous Monitoring or prioritization for the Joint Authorization Board here.

<p class="gd_p">
  This blog will give us a space to share the latest and greatest information as it happens. We know that transparency and collaboration is the only way to truly meet all of your needs, and <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/focus-on-fedramp/">Focus on FedRAMP</a> is designed with that in mind. Our goal is to post articles at least twice a week &#8211; so bookmark this page and check back frequently! Our next entry will detail the release of our new marketplace dashboard &#8211; all of the features you asked for and ways you can interact with it. Stay tuned!
