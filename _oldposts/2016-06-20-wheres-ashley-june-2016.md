We’ve been on an amazing journey together. For the past few months, you’ve followed FedRAMP’s Agency Roadshow and #WheresAshley campaigns as I’ve visited agencies, CSPs, 3PAOs, and the public. And what a ride it’s been! In the past weeks, <a href="https://www.govloop.com/6-questions-for-fedramp-agency-evangelist-ashley-mahan/">Govloop</a>, <a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2016/05/03/mahan-fedramp-rockwell.aspx">FCW</a>, and <a href="http://www.federaltimes.com/story/government/interview/one-one/2016/04/13/mahan-program-view/82353336/">Federal Times</a> published great articles about FedRAMP’s agency outreach. I’ve spoken at federal cloud panels across Washington, D.C., including RedHat’s Government IT panel held last month. Check out this picture from the event:

Speaking opportunities give me a chance to educate the federal IT, cloud industry and the public about the importance of FedRAMP. On May 20th, the FedRAMP PMO, myself, Matt Goodrich, John Hamilton and Claudio Belloli, spoke at the ISC2 CyberSecureGov 2016 conference. We had an amazing time and were able to explain the PMO&#8217;s upcoming initiatives and answer many questions.

But what’s coming next? Well, I’m glad you’re still interested! I’ll be embarking on a West Coast tour of agencies and cloud service providers. I’ll meet with members of federal agencies and cloud service providers to spread the roles and responsibilities of both in the FedRAMP process. I will continue to push for safe and secure cloud adoption across the federal government. 

If you are an Agency and need assistance navigating the FedRAMP process or further understanding of FedRAMP Compliant/In-Process cloud services, I am here to help! I visit several Federal agencies each week and want to meet with you! Feel free to contact me: Agency@FedRAMP.gov. I’m also on twitter: [@FedRAMPAshley](https://twitter.com/fedrampashley) and the hashtags: #WheresAshley, #OneTeamOneDream, #OTOD!
