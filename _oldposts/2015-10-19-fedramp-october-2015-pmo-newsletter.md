## **Commonly Missed Documents**

Submitting a complete authorization package helps to speed-up processing time and the time to initiate a package review. But the PMO office has noticed a trend of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) neglecting to include the fifteen required documents for an [Initial Review](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/08/FedRAMP-Initial-Review-SOP-v1-3.pdf). A list of the required documents can be found in the [Initial Review Standard Operating Procedure](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/08/FedRAMP-Initial-Review-SOP-v1-3.pdf).

The PMO has put together a list of the top five commonly missed required documents to help CSPs put together a complete Authorization Package the first-time around.

## **Lessons Learned: Initial Review**

Over the past few months, the FedRAMP PMO has conducted nearly 20 [Initial Reviews](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/08/FedRAMP-Initial-Review-SOP-v1-3.pdf) of CSP packages. These reviews evaluated twenty-one Critical Controls for readability, relevance, sufficiency, and consistency. FedRAMP’s definition of each criteria is as follows:

<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <b>Readable: </b>Can we understand what was written?
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <b>Relevant: </b>Did the statement actually address the control requirement?
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <b>Sufficient:</b> Is there enough detail to fully address all portions of the requirement and meet any security related needs?  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400">
      Tip: This is usually the “how” of a control statement.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <b>Consistent:</b> Do the implementation statements and the control template checkboxes match? <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400">
      Tip: Is &#8220;Implemented&#8221; checked when a response describes the solution is in place?
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
