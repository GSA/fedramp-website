The FedRAMP PMO is releasing an updated draft high baseline for a second round of public comments. This baseline is being released for our industry and agency stakeholders to provide their final feedback and recommendations. The public comment period will end Friday, January 8, 2016.

The draft high baseline was originally released for public comment in March 2015 and, in September 2015, the FedRAMP PMO convened a tiger team of High Impact system owners and agency leads to adjudicate the first round of public comments. This second round of public comments will provide summary details for each control that had comments and the disposition of those comments from the tiger teams and the Joint Authorization Board (JAB).

The draft baseline is at the High/High/High categorization level for confidentiality, integrity, and availability in accordance with FIPS 199. This baseline is mapped to the security controls from the NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 4 catalog of security controls.

The open comment period is from Friday, December 18, 2015 to Friday, January 8, 2016. All details about this request for feedback and documents to review are available at: [www.FedRAMP.gov](https://www.fedramp.gov/?p=42531).

**THERE WILL BE NO EXTENSIONS FOR COMMENTS.**
