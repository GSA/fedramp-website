Please be advised, beginning January 1, 2016, the FedRAMP PMO will only accept Â materials aligned to the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) [Revision 4](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-53-rev4/sp800-53-rev4-ipd.pdf) standards. Any Revision 3 documentation submitted to the PMO after that time will not be accepted. The FedRAMP PMO has updated the [Revision 4 Transition Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/01/FedRAMP-Rev-4-Transition-Guide-v3-0.pdf), which sets a hard deadline for all Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to transition to the NIST [Revision 4](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-53-rev4/sp800-53-rev4-ipd.pdf) standards.

The FedRAMP website also currently contains Revision 4 templates , an updated [FedRAMP Revision 3 to Revision 4 Annual Assessment Control Template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/01/FedRAMP-Rev3-to-Rev-4-Annual-Assessment-Controls-Template-v2-0.xlsx) and [Revision 4 Test Cases](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/01/FedRAMP-Revision-4-Security-Assessment-Test-Cases-v2-0.xlsx) are available on the [Templates](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/templates-3/) section of the website.
