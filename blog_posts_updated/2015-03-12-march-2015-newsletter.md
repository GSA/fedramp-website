## New FedRAMP Website!
After months of research, development, and design, the revamped FedRAMP website is ready to launch. The new [www.FedRAMP.gov](https://www.fedramp.gov) focuses on creating a user experience that enables users to gain  a deeper understanding of FedRAMP.

The desire to create a great user experience, combined with  feedback gathered from customer interviews, drove the redesign of FedRAMP’s website. The new [FedRAMP.gov](https://www.fedramp.gov) provides an easily navigable site that helps visitors:

  * Understand FedRAMP and its strategic direction
  * Quickly find current templates and key documents
  * Access on demand educational opportunities and information on FedRAMP events

Take some time to familiarize yourself with the redesigned FedRAMP website, its new layout, and features. Remember, the website will be continuously updated. The Project Management Office encourages everyone to check the site regularly and contribute feedback by emailing info@FedRAMP.gov.

        On-Demand Training Now Available



        In addition to unveiling the website, FedRAMP is launching a training program aimed at educating our stakeholders on the FedRAMP program. The e-learning training provides users with an understanding of the program and the level of effort required to comply with FedRAMP requirements. A course listing is available on the FedRAMP.gov website under the “Resources” tab. FedRAMP currently offers an on-demand introductory course about the process. The aim is for FedRAMP.gov users to take advantage of the  training course to increase their knowledge and understanding of FedRAMP and the program’s requirements for authorizing cloud computing solutions for the Federal Government.

### REV 4 Test Case Released

FedRAMP released the test cases based on the NIST Special Publication 800-53A, [Rev4 Transition Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/03/FedRAMP-Revision-4-Transition-Guide-v1.0-1.docx), Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations: Building Effective Assessment Plans and incorporating FedRAMP requirements.

The workbook provides a standard risk and controls template for assessing baseline controls and helps to drive consistency in the annual assessment testing performed by Third Party Assessor Organizations (3PAOs). 3PAOs use this workbook to test selected baseline controls per required test procedures and document any control deficiencies and findings.
