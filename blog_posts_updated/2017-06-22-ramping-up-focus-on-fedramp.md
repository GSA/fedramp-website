After recently celebrating our [Fifth Birthday and logo update](https://www.fedramp.gov/67092-2/), the FedRAMP PMO is excited to announce a few more changes to our website in the form of a new blog series and newly created [Tips & Cues Page](https://www.fedramp.gov/?p=66820).

In the interest of communicating information about how to best work with FedRAMP regularly, we will be introducing a series of multi-part blogs. These series will be published weekly, in addition to any programmatic updates that occur. Our series of blogs will cover the following topics:

* Understanding FedRAMP

* Understanding the Readiness Assessment Report (RAR)

* Tips for working towards an Agency ATO and becoming In Process with an Agency

* Acquisitions

Additionally, we’re excited to show off our newly created FedRAMP [Tips & Cues page](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/fedramp-tips-cues/). Rather than publishing the Tips & Cues within the Focus on FedRAMP Blog each week, we’ve moved all of the FedRAMP Tips & Cues to this new page. With the Tips & Cues now in one location, they will be more accessible and easier for our stakeholders to search.

If you have ideas about topics for the Focus on FedRAMP Blog or Tips & Cues that it would be helpful for us to cover, please e-mail [info@fedramp.gov](mailto:info@fedramp.gov).
