### Commonly Missed Documents

Submitting a complete authorization package helps to speed-up processing time and the time to initiate a package review. But the PMO office has noticed a trend of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) neglecting to include the fifteen required documents for an [Initial Review](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/08/FedRAMP-Initial-Review-SOP-v1-3.pdf). A list of the required documents can be found in the [Initial Review Standard Operating Procedure](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/08/FedRAMP-Initial-Review-SOP-v1-3.pdf).

The PMO has put together a list of the top five commonly missed required documents to help CSPs put together a complete Authorization Package the first-time around.

### Lessons Learned: Initial Review

Over the past few months, the FedRAMP PMO has conducted nearly 20 [Initial Reviews](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/08/FedRAMP-Initial-Review-SOP-v1-3.pdf) of CSP packages. These reviews evaluated twenty-one Critical Controls for readability, relevance, sufficiency, and consistency. FedRAMP’s definition of each criteria is as follows:


  **Readable:** Can we understand what was written?


  **Relevant:** Did the statement actually address the control requirement?


  **Sufficient:** Is there enough detail to fully address all portions of the requirement and meet any security related needs?  

  * Tip: This is usually the “how” of a control statement.

  **Consistent:** Do the implementation statements and the control template checkboxes match?

  * Tip: Is Implemented checked when a response describes the solution is in place?
