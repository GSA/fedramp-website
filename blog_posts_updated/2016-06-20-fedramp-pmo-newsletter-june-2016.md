### High Baseline Release

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is excited to release the [FedRAMP High Baseline Requirements](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2016/06/FedRAMP-High-HHH-Baseline-Controls-2016-05-18.xlsx)! The High Baseline is available on [www.FedRAMP.gov](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents-2016/). These security requirements will be used to protect some of the government’s most sensitive, unclassified data in cloud computing environments. This release allows agencies to use cloud environments for high-impact data, including data that involves the protection of life and financial ruin.

Why is this such a big deal? While 80% of Federal information is categorized at low and moderate impact levels, this only represents about 50% of Federal IT spend. Now that FedRAMP has set the requirements for high impact levels, that breaks open the remaining 50% of the $80 billion a year the US Government spends on IT that could potentially move to the cloud securely. That’s huge!

### Call to Action

**This is your chance to have your voice heard!**
The FedRAMP PMO needs volunteers to participate in developing the JAB prioritization criteria as part of the FedRAMP Accelerated program. The PMO is partnering [ACT-IAC](https://www.actiac.org/events/jab-prioritization-work-stream-kickoff-virtual-meeting) to establish the benchmarks for the new JAB process, and you can be a part of developing the new criteria.

The JAB prioritization workstream will kick off on Wednesday, July 29th, culminating in a solidified document on Monday, July 25th. The workstream webinar will begin at 2 pm ET. Ashley Mahan, FedRAMP Evangelist, and Eric Adams, industry POC, will lead the sessions. ACT-IAC members should register [here](https://www.actiac.org/events/jab-prioritization-work-stream-kickoff-virtual-meeting) and non-members should register [here](http://rwright@actiac.org).

In March 2016, the FedRAMP PMO unveiled the Accelerated program, a means to a faster, more transparent JAB authorization. In the Accelerated process, the JAB will prioritize and select the cloud systems it wishes to evaluate.

Any member of the federal government (employee and contractor), cloud service provider, industry, or others interested in the JAB prioritization criteria are invited to join these session. If you are interested in joining the JAB prioritization workstream, email [info@FedRAMP.gov](mailto:info@FedRAMP.gov) with the subject line “JAB Prioritization Workstream.” Please include your organization and contact information in the email.**

### New Compliant CSPs!

The FedRAMP PMO is excited to announce six new FedRAMP Compliant systems and one FedRAMP Ready system!

      [AT&T Government Cloud](https://www.fedramp.gov/marketplace/compliant-systems/att-att-government-cloud/) received a JAB Provisional Authorization (P-ATO) on May 19, 2016.


        The AGC is designed to provision virtual hardware, storage, and networks for clients rapidly to use as an infrastructure upon which they can install or provision platform and software services.  By the AGC utilizing virtualization technologies, the risk of investment for Federal clients is reduced. By hosting all virtual elements on a secure, fully integrated, highly configurable, and easily expanded hardware platform, AGC will greatly reduce Assessment and Authorization (A&A) approval cycles for Federal clients for their own-hosted systems, as a result of the significant number of inheritable controls provided by this underlying infrastructure.</td> </tr>

### FedRAMP Accelerated Process

On March 28, 2016, FedRAMP announced the new FedRAMP Accelerated process, which includes significant modifications to how FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional Authorizations (P-ATO) are conducted. The goal of the new process is to provide a significantly faster, more predictable timeline for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) seeking to have their packages assessed as FedRAMP Authorized.

### Updates to FedRAMP Templates

On Monday, June 27th FedRAMP will be releasing updates to our templates to add some “ease of use” features as well as ensure all of the templates reflect the different authorization levels (low, moderate, high) that CSPs can pursue through FedRAMP.

The updates to our templates include the following “ease-of-use” features:

### #Where’s Ashley?

We’ve been on an amazing journey together. For the past few months, you’ve followed FedRAMP’s Agency Roadshow and #WheresAshley campaigns as I’ve visited agencies, CSPs, 3PAOs and the public. And what a ride it’s been! In the past month, [Govloop](https://www.govloop.com/6-questions-for-fedramp-agency-evangelist-ashley-mahan/), [FCW](https://fcw.com/articles/2016/05/03/mahan-fedramp-rockwell.aspx), and [Federal Times](http://www.federaltimes.com/story/government/interview/one-one/2016/04/13/mahan-program-view/82353336/) published great articles about FedRAMP’s agency outreach. I’ve spoken at federal cloud panels across Washington, D.C., including RedHat’s Government IT panel held just last week.
