  If you found FedRAMP’s first training course helpful, then you will be excited to learn the next training course is not too far behind! Expected to launch on July 1, 2015, the second course in our training series, “FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP) Required Documents” will be mandatory for SSP submission. This course will familiarize you with the required documentation for initial package submission.



  The FedRAMP PMO understands that writing a detailed SSP is necessary for a successful initial review. This course will provide a detailed overview of an SSP and its supporting documents, to give you the tools to accurately describe your system’s security controls. This is the second course in the FedRAMP training series and more will be released in the coming months.
