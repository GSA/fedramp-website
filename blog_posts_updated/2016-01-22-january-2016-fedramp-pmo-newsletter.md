### Feature Item: The Evolution of FedRAMP

As we approached our fourth year of helping agencies secure the cloud solutions they use, we here at [FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/) undertook a comprehensive outreach effort to learn as much as possible about how we’re meeting your needs. In response to your feedback, we’re shifting our efforts to scale the things we’re doing well, and we’re also working to improve the areas you’d like to see changed.

### Reader Submission from Jeffrey Widom

This month, the PMO features a column from Lunarline’s Jeffrey Widom. He presents some common topics Cloud Service Provider’s (CSPs) have faced when deciding to pursue a FedRAMP Authorization.

**Is the FedRAMP JAB P-ATO considered the “highest level” of FedRAMP compliance?**

Each FedRAMP path is valid. The JAB, Agency, CSP-Supplied paths have the same content and must meet the same stringent FedRAMP PMO requirements for entry into the repository. The primary difference is continuous monitoring and risk management.

FedRAMP’s Agency Evangelist is coming to a Federal agency near you!

Ashley Mahan is leading a focused outreach effort to identify agency leads who will coordinate cross-government use of FedRAMP. Ashley will visit with each agency within the Executive Branch as well as a number of other agencies and state-governments. This is each agency’s chance to speak directly with the PMO about their experience with the FedRAMP process and provide feedback and potential improvements.
